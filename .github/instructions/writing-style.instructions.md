# Writing Style Instructions

This document provides comprehensive guidelines for writing clear, professional, and accessible content across all project documents. These instructions prioritize clarity and conversational tone while maintaining professional standards.

## Core Writing Principles

### 1. Language and Tone

- **Use US English spelling and grammar** throughout all documents
- **Write in a professional yet conversational tone** - avoid overly formal or "posh" language
- **Use accessible vocabulary** - choose clear, straightforward words over complex alternatives
- **Employ contractions appropriately** (e.g., "don't" instead of "do not") to maintain conversational flow
- **Prefer active voice** over passive voice when possible

### 2. Clarity and Accessibility

- **Avoid the curse of knowledge** - don't assume readers have prior knowledge of topics
- **Make content self-sufficient** - provide all necessary information so readers don't need to ask clarifying questions
- **Define technical terms** when first introduced
- **Use simple sentence structures** to enhance readability
- **Break up complex ideas** into digestible chunks
- **Aim for transparency** - eliminate words or structures that call attention to themselves
- **Trust your conversational voice** - use language that comes naturally to you
- **Write to express, not impress** - focus on clear thinking rather than showing off vocabulary

## Document Structure

### 3. Organization and Flow

- **Follow the three-part structure**: Opening, Middle, Closing
- **Lead with key information** in each section
- **Use logical progression** from general to specific concepts
- **Create smooth transitions** between sections and ideas
- **End with clear next steps** or conclusions

### 4. High Skim Value

Enhance documents for easy scanning by using:

- **Clear headings and subheadings** in a consistent hierarchy
- **Bulleted and numbered lists** for multiple items
- **Short paragraphs** (3-4 sentences maximum)
- **Bold text** for key terms and important points
- **White space** to separate sections and improve readability
- **Section overviews** - provide prose that surfaces key points before diving into details
- **Conclusion orientation** - lead each section with its main point
- **Coherence cues** - use advance organizers to guide readers through your logic

## Document Design

### 5. Visual Elements

- **Use conventional formatting** - documents should look as expected for their type
- **Maintain consistent styling** across all project documents
- **Choose readable fonts and sizes** (typically 11-12pt for body text)
- **Use appropriate margins** and spacing
- **Apply consistent bullet styles** and indentation
- **Create visually inviting documents** - avoid long paragraphs and uninterrupted text blocks
- **Build in visual variety** - balance text with white space and formatting elements
- **Enable easy navigation** - help readers find key information quickly

### 6. Professional Standards

- **Proofread all content** for spelling, grammar, and logic
- **Maintain consistent terminology** throughout the project
- **Use parallel structure** in lists and headings
- **Follow standard punctuation rules**
- **Ensure proper capitalization** of proper nouns and titles

## Specific Language Guidelines

### 7. Word Choice

**Use these preferred terms:**

- "Use" instead of "utilize"
- "Help" instead of "assist" or "facilitate"
- "Show" instead of "demonstrate" or "illustrate"
- "Start" instead of "commence" or "initiate"
- "End" instead of "terminate" or "conclude"
- "Get" instead of "obtain" or "acquire"

### 8. Sentence Construction

- **Keep sentences under 25 words** when possible
- **Use coordination ("and")** instead of subordination ("but") when connecting positive ideas
- **Place important information first** in each sentence
- **Avoid unnecessary qualifiers** like "very," "quite," or "rather"
- **Use specific nouns and verbs** instead of generic ones
- **Prefer active voice** over passive voice for clarity and accountability
- **Use parallel structure** for items that serve the same function
- **Give yourself permission to use personal pronouns** (I, we, you) when appropriate

## Writing Style Management

### 9. Common Phrasing Issues to Avoid

**Passive Voice Overuse:**

- Use active voice to show who's doing what
- Reserve passive voice for when the actor is unknown or unimportant
- Example: "The team completed the project" (not "The project was completed by the team")

**Wordy Expressions:**

- "Due to the fact that" → "Because"
- "At that point in time" → "Then"
- "Make a decision about" → "Decide"
- "Came to the conclusion that" → "Concluded"

**Unnecessary Repetition:**

- Avoid doublets: "each and every" → "every"
- Cut obvious statements: Don't start with "First of all"
- Eliminate redundant phrases: "five-year period" → "five years"

## Content-Specific Guidelines

### 10. Technical Writing

- **Explain acronyms** on first use
- **Use examples** to clarify abstract concepts
- **Include context** for technical decisions
- **Write step-by-step instructions** for procedures
- **Test instructions** to ensure they're complete

### 11. Academic (and Course) Content

- **Connect new concepts** to previously learned material
- **Use real-world examples** to illustrate theoretical points
- **Provide multiple explanations** for complex topics
- **Include reflection questions** to engage readers
- **Reference source materials** appropriately

## Tone and Voice Management

### 12. Professional Tone Guidelines

**Choose appropriate formality level based on:**

- Your relationship with readers
- Sensitivity of the topic
- Organizational culture and expectations

**Tone adjustment techniques:**

- **For softer tone:** "You might consider..." "Might I suggest..."
- **For neutral tone:** State facts directly and clearly
- **For emphasis:** Use specific, concrete language

**Word choice considerations:**

- Select neutral words over emotionally charged alternatives
- Be mindful of connotations and implied judgments
- Adapt vocabulary to your audience's expertise level
