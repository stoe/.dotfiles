## Documentation Requirements

- Follow standard JavaScript/TypeScript/Node.js (JSDoc/HereDoc) conventions and best practices
- Add JSDoc/HereDoc if missing, but keep it short. Do not align it.
- Add comments to explain complex logic or non-obvious implementations
- Place inline comments above the code, not on the same line
- Use full sentences for comments
- Never comment in Markdown, except code blocks
